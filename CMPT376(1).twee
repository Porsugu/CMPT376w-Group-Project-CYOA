You feel curious about the accuracy rate of the system works. An engineer responds: "The system has 91% accuracy..." You notice the hesitation of the engineer before answering, when you look at him, he tries to avoid eye conatct. 

After a short scients, he continues "But we do acknowledge there’s a 9% false-positive rate. Hem... that means there will be some innocent will be threatened by the sonic pulses or electrical deterrents. Yet, we are... still working on it to minimize the percentage as much as we can!"

One of the engineer continues, "Which means... every 11 people that has been marked, there is 1 who actually does not cause any threads to the society. To make a better understanding, with a medium sized downtown city, there's about 450 innocent people per day would be subjected to automated force."

Untill now, you would...

Thank you for playing.

Whatever choices you made in this story, the most important thing is that you reflected on what felt most ethical to you. These dilemmas rarely have just one right answer, even when we think them through over and over.

:: Meeting [Choice Accuracy Support Objection NeutralResponse] {"position":"475,350","size":"100,100"}
At the meeting, you find yourself among the top executives. One steps forward, unveiling Project Sentinel: an AI-driven surveillance and response system.

“It’s designed to run across public and private spaces,” he says, “using advanced behavioral analysis and predictive algorithms to detect potential threats. Most impressive, it can autonomously deploy non-lethal force: sonic pulses, electrical deterrents, targeted containment — all without human oversight.”

As the presentation fades, unease stirs inside you. Is this a breakthrough for public safety, or a dangerous step toward unchecked control?

What will you do?

:: NeutralResponse {"position":"350,475","size":"100,100"}
An engineer responds cautiously, “The system has a 91% accuracy rate...” You catch the brief hesitation in his voice, and when someone glances his way, he quickly looks down, avoiding eye contact.

After a strained pause, he adds, “Of course, we acknowledge there’s a 9% false-positive rate. That means... some innocent people could be mistakenly targeted — threatened by sonic pulses, electrical deterrents. We’re... still working to minimize that number.”

Another engineer chimes in, voice lower, “To put it simply... for every 11 people flagged, one poses no real threat. In a medium-sized downtown, that’s about 450 innocent people per day exposed to automated force.”

You stay silent, absorbing the information, but you realize you have missed your chance to steer the discussion.

You are a respected engineer at one of the world’s largest companies, Intel.

One morning, as you scroll through your inbox, a strange subject line catches your eye: “Classified Invitation — Project Sentinel.” It’s from NVIDIA.

The email outlines a national security initiative claiming it can prevent mass threats. But as you read, doubts creep in — could this powerful system also be misused as a tool of control and harm?

You are left with a choice that could change the future.

What will you do?
