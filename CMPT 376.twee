The AI engages without hesitation. The system operates with calculated precision during the following weeks to detect and destroy numerous targets automatically. The system detected actual threats which existed as dangerous silhouettes. <span style="color: #FFFF77;">The system captured numerous innocent people who became trapped in the unyielding system of suspicion and algorithmic certainty. </span>

<span style="color: #FFFF77">Each case chips away at your conscience. </span>

You recall the human faces which appeared in statistical reports about the father who never returned home and the teenager who was wrongly identified as a suspect and the elderly woman who remained unproven innocent. 

The media produces increasingly negative reports while protests emerge and <span style="color: #FFFF77;">you remain caught between your admiration for the technology's operational efficiency and your disgust at its unyielding mistakes.</span> You wonder whether you built a defensive system or an evil entity. Your faith in redemption diminishes with each passing life the AI takes as its operational domain expands.

You feel curious about the accuracy rate of the system's work. An engineer responds, <span style="color: #FFFF77;">"The system has 91% accuracy..."</span> You notice the hesitation of the engineer before answering. When you look at him, he tries to avoid eye contact. 

After a short sentence, he continues, "But we do acknowledge <span style="color: #FFFF77;">there‚Äôs ''a 9% false-positive rate.'' Hmm... that means there will be some innocents who will be threatened by the sonic pulses or electrical deterrents.</span> Yet, we are... still working on it to minimise the percentage as much as we can!"

One of the engineers continues, "Which means... <span style="color: #FFFF77;">''every 11 people that has been marked, there is 1 who actually does not cause ANY threads to society.''</span> To make a better understanding, in a medium-sized downtown city, there are <span style="color: #FFFF77;">about ''450 innocent people per day'' who would be subjected to automated force. </span>"

Another slide flashes on the screen. If  the pilot program begins, violent incidents in the city will be <span style="color: #FFFF77;">''dropped by 38%''</span>. An engineer adds, ‚ÄúWe estimate <span style="color: #FFFF77;">''over 8,000 potential casualties will been prevented this year''</span> alone.

:: StayQuiet {"position":"1075,1150","size":"100,100"}
You close the folder. You thank the engineers for coming, tell them you‚Äôll "look into it." But the next morning, <span style="color: #FFFF77;">the logs are gone</span>, some even buried and encrypted. In the end, all are out of reach. You say nothing. No press conferences, no testimonies, no confrontation. And life goes on. <span style="color: #FFFF77;">You keep your position. Your salary. Your silence. </span>

At meetings, you nod along as Sentinel is praised. In public, you smile politely when reporters call it a marvel of modern security. But at night, when the world is quiet and the weight of your choice presses in, you hear their names, the ones in the file. You see their faces. You wonder what their final moments were like, and whether your hesitation to act would haunt anyone but you. 

Over time, your title means less. The paychecks blur. But the guilt? It sharpens. 

<span style="color: #FFFF77">You become a respected figure, but one who flinches at their own reflection. 

You survive. But something inside you doesn‚Äôt.</span>

//You have chosen the silent tragedy over justice. It's not a dramatic failure of making a wrong choice, but just that you have chosen the long-term poison of not doing anything. <span style="color: #77c9ff">''You survived, but you pay the cost of your soul.'' </span>

The disappeared log, evidence ... is not the only cover-up of the company; it's that you place yourself on the side of the innocents' justice. Yet, the only honest part is that <span style="color: #77c9ff">''you still remember their faces. 
You keep this in mind, no matter how painful it is.'' </span>//

:: Support [Support Crisis] {"position":"525,500","size":"100,100"}
<span style="color: #FFFF77;"> You voice your support for the project, emphasising the potential of saving lives and reducing crimes in the city.</span> All of a sudden, the room's atmosphere shifts, several executives nod and approve, while others exchange a glance. The CEO make a note on his tablet. 

<span style="color: #FFFF77;">Within a week, you were promoted to Senior Operations Directorüëî. </span>

When you returned to the office, your colleagues looked at you, and you discovered that a new security clearance badge lay on your desk. You have been granted access to restricted floors and secret project files. <span style="color: #FFFF77;"> You are also being invited to join the testing group and provide advice. </span>

:: SupportWithRisks [Accuracy Crisis] {"position":"1250,450","size":"100,100"}
<span style="color: #FFFF77;">You argue that the benefits outweigh risks</span>,"The potential to save lives and prevent crimes justifies the statistical margin of errors. <span style="color: #FFFF77;">''We can't let statistical imperfection prevent us from protecting innocent lives.''"</span>

<span style="color: #FFFF77;">"''We can't wait until there is perfect accuracy, even though people die every day because of the security problem!''" </span>

Everyone stands up and gives you applause. Executives looking at you with satisfied smiles, this is what they actually want. 

Thus, the project has been fast-tracked with emergency funding and executive priority. The timeline has changed from an 18-month gradual rollout to a 9-week emergency deployment. <span style="color: #FFFF77;">The normal approval process has been bypassed, and the public hearings have been cancelled. </span>The deployment begins in high-traffic areas within days, and the public doesn't know what will happen next.

:: SystemSuccess {"position":"1200,900","size":"100,100"}
You go through the system logs one by one, taking your time but staying focused. Your heart stays steady even though your mind is racing. Each entry is more than just data - it's a story about disaster that almost happened.

A suicide bomber stopped before he reached a crowded square. An arms dealer caught in the middle of a deal at some quiet caf√©. A school attack that got shut down before it even started.

The numbers don't tell you about the chaos that could have been. But you can see it. You can feel it. <span style="color: #FFFF77;">These aren't just statistics, they're actual lives, futures that still exist, families that are still together.</span>

You let yourself breathe for a second. Then you get back to work. By every measure, Sentinel is doing what it's supposed to do. It's protecting people. The logs make that pretty clear. But you can't shake the feeling of how much power this thing has. You know better than anyone that it cuts both ways. Every success comes with the possibility of something going terribly wrong.

Outside your office, people seem cautiously hopeful. The news is mostly positive. Commentators are giving it careful praise. But you know how easily that could change. 

<span style="color: #FFFF77;">One mistake. 
One innocent person dies. 
That's all it would take for everyone to turn against the system. </span>

You finish looking through everything and lean back in your chair. Not relieved, just aware of what you've seen. <span style="color: #FFFF77;">This is incredible technology. But that means it has to be held to an even higher standard.</span>

:: Untitled Passage {"position":"1700,675","size":"100,100"}
It is currently 5:37 PM and your phone is vibrating like crazy, making all sorts of sharp, buzzing sensations. Soon after, the AI surveillance dashboard lights up. You gear  towards the dashboard and see red, blinking "urgent" messages. A man with a black backpack has been flagged at St. Lucifer Station, which is ironically the same station your daughter, Jennifer, transfers through every day on her way home from school. The AI flags him as a high-probability threat. Your breath catches. His face is calm, almost unreadable. No criminal history. No weapons detected. Yet the AI flags that his behavior fits the profile, and time is running out. You feel your chest tighten, a cold knot of fear and responsibility twisting inside you. Every second that passes is a razor‚Äôs edge between safety and disaster. 

Your mind races thoughts of doubts, such as, what if this is a false alarm? The weight of possibly killing an innocent man crushes you. But what if you hesitate and fail to act? Your daughter‚Äôs laughter echoes in your memory, and the thought of her hurt shakes you to the core. Do you demand a manual override, risking delay and hoping for human judgment? Or do you give in to the cold certainty of the system, pressing the button to end the threat before it can move? You consider checking the logs, which consists of hundreds of past successes, but simultaneously a handful of tragic mistakes too. You hate that the numbers can‚Äôt tell you if this man is a danger or just another face in the crowd. 



:: Whistleblower {"position":"1075,1025","size":"100,100"}
A thick oppressive silence engulfed the conference space. The engineers maintained nervous glances between themselves and you as they sat together at the long table. The screen light produced dramatic shadows which fell across the collection of folders that you and others had risked their safety to gather.

The lead engineer expressed his concern through a tight voice as he started his statement, "the AI system existed to defend our systems, instead the system began producing fatal errors during some point in its operation. Our investigation revealed numerous wrongful deaths and injuries together with many innocent victims...Innocent people." She swallowed hard and continuted with her statement. <span style="color: #FFFF77">"The lack of accountability has been devastating because ''no one has received apologies or reparations''. No apologies, no reparations. Just silence."</span>

A nearby engineer leaned in close while speaking in a barely audible tone. 

<span style="color: #FFFF77">''"The public needs your exposure of these facts. "''</span>

"In other words, the public needs to understand the truth although it will result in total destruction. Our silence will result in more lives being taken."

A familiar feeling of dread started to build up in your chest after you took your breath. Your entire career built upon this system came to utter disapointment. As a result, you declared, 

<span style="color: #fd2550">''"I would lose my position as well as my public image and possibly face imprisonment if I decide to reveal the truth."</span>''

You clenched your fists while fighting to maintain control over your emotions. The choice to remain quiet would render me responsible for ongoing death and suffering. I can never find peace after making such a choice.
