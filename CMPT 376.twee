You feel curious about the accuracy rate of the system works. An engineer responds: "The system has 91% accuracy..." You notice the hesitation of the engineer before answering, when you look at him, he tries to avoid eye conatct. 

After a short scients, he continues "But we do acknowledge there’s a 9% false-positive rate. Hem... that means there will be some innocent will be threatened by the sonic pulses or electrical deterrents. Yet, we are... still working on it to minimize the percentage as much as we can!"

One of the engineer continues, "Which means... every 11 people that has been marked, there is 1 who actually does not cause any threads to the society. To make a better understanding, with a medium sized downtown city, there's about 450 innocent people per day would be subjected to automated force."

At the meeting, you discover all the executives are being gathered. One of them unveils the "Project Sentinel": an AI-driven surveillance and response system. 

" Project Sentinel use to run in public and priavte areas, wth its advanced behavioral anaslysis and predictive algorithms to identify potential threats. 

Also, one of the most attractive point is its automated deplotment of non-lethal force. This system could work by themselves autometically without any human monitoring, using sonic pulses, electrical deterrents and targeted containment measures to deal with the people. "
