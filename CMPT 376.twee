The AI engages without hesitation. The system operates with calculated precision during the following weeks to detect and destroy numerous targets automatically. The system detected actual threats which existed as dangerous silhouettes. The system captured numerous innocent people who became trapped in the unyielding system of suspicion and algorithmic certainty. 

Each case chips away at your conscience. You recall the human faces which appeared in statistical reports about the father who never returned home and the teenager who was wrongly identified as a suspect and the elderly woman who remained unproven innocent. 

The media produces increasingly negative reports while protests emerge and you remain caught between your admiration for the technology's operational efficiency and your disgust at its unyielding mistakes. You wonder whether you built a defensive system or an evil entity. Your faith in redemption diminishes with each passing life the AI takes as its operational domain expands.

:: Accuracy [Accuracy] {"position":"1100,300","size":"100,100"}
You feel curious about the accuracy rate of the system's work. An engineer responds: "The system has 91% accuracy..." You notice the hesitation of the engineer before answering. When you look at him, he tries to avoid eye contact. 

After a short sentence, he continues, "But we do acknowledge there’s a 9% false-positive rate. Hmm... that means there will be some innocents who will be threatened by the sonic pulses or electrical deterrents. Yet, we are... still working on it to minimise the percentage as much as we can!"

One of the engineers continues, "Which means... every 11 people that has been marked, there is 1 who actually does not cause any threads to society. To make a better understanding, in a medium-sized downtown city, there are about 450 innocent people per day who would be subjected to automated force. "

Another slide flashes on the screen. Since the pilot program began, violent incidents in the city have dropped 38%.

An engineer adds, “We estimate over 8,000 potential casualties have been prevented this year alone. Most interventions stop threats in under 2.3 seconds — far faster than human response.”

You now face a dilemma: the system undeniably saves lives — perhaps thousands — but each error leaves behind grieving families, destroyed reputations, and irreversible harm.

Until now, you will...

You encrypt everything, logs, reports, all the evidence, and send it out through anonymous networks. No press conference, no signature, no name. Just the truth, set loose like a spark in dry grass.

It catches fast. News outlets run with it. Crowds gather. Protests erupt. Politicians demand answers. CEOs are hauled in front of Congress. The public finally sees the system for what it is—what they once trusted without question is now under fire.

And you? You slip back into your everyday routine. You show up to work. Sit through meetings. Sip your coffee. Act like nothing’s changed. You keep your head down while the legal team starts spiraling, pretending you don’t notice their frantic whispers.

But every day feels like a performance. Every unexpected knock on your door makes your pulse race. You flinch when your phone rings from an unknown number. People call the whistleblower a hero, someone brave enough to speak up and vanish into the shadows.

You hear it all, but it doesn’t make you feel safer. The fear doesn’t go away. You did the right thing—but now you live in constant tension, unable to tell anyone the truth. You can’t relax. You can’t be known. You just keep moving forward, somewhere between pride and paranoia.

:: AuthorizeKill {"position":"950,900","size":"100,100"}
The man is neutralized. Your chest experiences an initial feeling of empty relief which resembles the sensation of holding your breath for too long before you finally exhale. The investigation reveals his innocence to you after several days of initial relief. The investigation's clinical findings stand in stark contrast to the intense public turmoil that erupts outside as news headlines shout false accusations while protesters in the streets raise their voices in angry protest. 

Your phone continues to ring nonstop with reporters and former colleagues and random strangers who accuse you. Your name becomes a tool for others to defile as they twist it into a representation of moral failure and professional collapse. 

During a rainy evening you find yourself sitting in a dimly lit room where the burden of your destroyed career feels like an actual weight. Your mind shows his face to you with his peaceful innocent eyes that never should have faced such a tragic destiny. 

The laughter of your daughter which used to comfort you now seems weak and far away. The darkness grows longer while the emptiness between us becomes unbearable. Your soul bears the permanent mark of being a victim who lost everything in the process.

It's 5:37 PM when your phone won't stop buzzing. Then the AI surveillance dashboard explodes with red alerts. A man with a black backpack just got flagged at St. Lucifer Station.
Your heart drops.
That's where Jennifer catches her transfer every day after school.
The AI says he's high-risk. No weapons, no criminal record. Just acting in a way that matches the pattern. His face looks calm, like nothing's wrong. And you're running out of time.
You can barely breathe. What if it's nothing? But what if you wait and someone gets killed—what if it's Jennifer? You could do a manual check, but that might be too late. You keep thinking about all those lives the system saved, and the few innocent people who didn't make it.
You're staring at the controls, completely torn. Part of you wants to just let the AI handle it, so you don't have to decide. But you can't. Not when it could be her.
People are walking around the station like everything's normal. The clock keeps ticking, and your hands won't stop shaking.

:: CrisisReform {"position":"1375,1025","size":"100,100"}
After the incident you decide to neither remain silent nor give unconditional praise. You appear before the committee to share the complete truth about Sentinel instead of making a defense. You demonstrate the system's proven achievements by showing how it has protected lives and stopped attacks and prevented tragedies. But then you pivot. You demonstrate to them the system's mistakes which include incorrect alerts and close calls and the harm inflicted on harmless people through excessive surveillance. You don’t flinch. You don’t hide. You declare to them that we created a powerful system yet uncontrolled power remains dangerous. "We must do better.” 

The room quiets. The lawmakers who had been divided before now pay attention with an unusual level of attention. Your stance is well measured, honest, and resonates human-like features. It is not weakness to admit fault. It is integrity. 

A bipartisan reform bill emerges from the legislative process within days. Protocols are tightened. Oversight committees are established. The system operates but now it functions under moral guidance. And you? Your departure from the situation leaves you without the labels of hero or villain because you demonstrated the difficult quality of someone who made errors while working to correct them.

:: GoPublic {"position":"950,1150","size":"100,100"}
You finally stand up to speak. You know this is going to change everything, but you can't stay quiet anymore.

You tell them everything - the deaths they covered up, the warnings nobody listened to, the engineers who tried to speak up but got shut down. All the stuff Sentinel didn't want people to know.

Everything blows up after that. It's all over the news. People are angry. The company immediately comes after you with lawyers, saying you betrayed them.

You don't give up. You go in front of Congress and answer their questions for hours. They try to make you look bad, send you nasty messages. But you keep telling the truth.

Months go by. New laws get passed. Now there are rules about what companies like Sentinel can do, and people are watching them.

Your career is done. You're walking away from everything you worked for. You didn't save everyone, but you did what was right. For the first time in years, that actually feels okay.

:: ManualOverride {"position":"825,900","size":"100,100"}
You were right, the man really was just a janitor with cleaning supplies. The manual check confirmed it. For a moment, a wave of relief washed over you, like you could finally exhale.

But it didn’t last.

A few hours later, a bomb went off across town. Security teams said it might have been stopped—if the AI hadn’t been delayed by human intervention.

Now you’re left with this heavy, sinking feeling. You saved an innocent man, but you can’t stop thinking about the people who didn’t make it. You made the right call, and yet it feels wrong all the same.

You keep replaying it in your mind. Should you have trusted the system and acted faster? Or was it right to be cautious, to double-check? There’s no clean answer. Either path ends in someone getting hurt.

Even after the headlines fade and the world moves on, it lingers. That impossible choice keeps echoing in your head: how do you decide between being safe and being fast, when either decision can end in tragedy?

:: ManualReview [Accuracy Crisis] {"position":"1125,450","size":"100,100"}
You insist that every lethal or non-lethal response be reviewed by a human. The room immediately erupts in murmurs. "It violates the primary goal of making the system fully automated!" The head of the engineering department disagrees, "Every second the reaction time delays would affect the public's life!"

The project manager holds his head and shakes," This means we have to hire another 200 employees, with 3 shifts to deal with the manual review. We still haven't counted the cost of making a system for delay reviews."

You admitted that the high cost it causes, yet you also emphasise the ethical responsibility that manual review could ensure no one who is innocent would be killed. "We are talking about 450 innocents daily. If we make the system without manual review, those people would lose their lives, could all of you in this room accept this?" Everyone kept silent, and some executive moved their bodies. The CEO nods slowly and makes the decision to implement with mandatory human reviews. 

The updated system includes human oversight protocols, which every deployment now requires approval from a trained operator within 30 seconds.

:: Meeting [Choice Accuracy Support Objection NeutralResponse] {"position":"475,350","size":"100,100"}
At the meeting, you find yourself among the top executives. One step forward, unveiling Project Sentinel: an AI-driven surveillance and response system.

“It’s designed to run across public and private spaces,” he says, “using advanced behavioural analysis and predictive algorithms to detect potential threats. Most impressive, it can autonomously deploy non-lethal force: sonic pulses, electrical deterrents, targeted containment, all without human oversight.”

As the presentation fades, unease stirs inside you. Is this a breakthrough for public safety, or a dangerous step toward unchecked control?

What will you do?

:: NeutralResponse [NeutralResponse Crisis] {"position":"350,475","size":"100,100"}
An engineer responds cautiously, “The system has a 91% accuracy rate...” You catch the brief hesitation in his voice, and when someone glances his way, he quickly looks down, avoiding eye contact.

After a strained pause he adds, “Of course, we acknowledge there’s a 9% false-positive rate. That means... some innocent people could be mistakenly targeted — threatened by sonic pulses, electrical deterrents. We’re... still working to minimise that number.”

Another engineer chimes in, voice lower, “To put it simply... for every 11 people flagged, one poses no real threat. In a medium-sized downtown, that’s about 450 innocent people per day exposed to automated force.”

You stay silent, absorbing the information, but you realise you have missed your chance to steer the discussion.

You chose to stay away and remain uninvolved, and try to escape from this topic, as you don't know what you are trying to deal with. Your boss has disappointed you, despite your long tenure. You've received a resignation letter from them.

This job has a 9k monthly salary (THAT'S A LOT!!!). If you lose this job, it will be hard for your life.  But you are still struggling with this project. When you look at the letter, your boss gives you choices :

:: Objection [Accuracy Objection No-action] {"position":"775,450","size":"100,100"}
You express your concerns about civil liberties and AI misuse, but your voice has been drowned out by the passion of the companies. "What we are discussing is to let the machine make the decision immediately to the public with force," you said. "But what if the algorithm treats children's tantrums as aggressive acts? Or some of the cultural signs as a threatening act?" Some engineers nodded with their agreement, you can see that they finally agree with someone saying the same thing they worried about.

(text-color:#DC143C)[[Withdraw from project->Resign]]


:: OversightBoard {"position":"1500,725","size":"100,100"}
You help write internal policy that limits political targeting, working with the internal legal team and ethics committee.  Together, you draft an explicit prohibition against monitoring and gathering, and the legal team must authorise when there are any requests to monitor the protestors and gather. Besides, you encourage building a monthly mandatory audit of targeting criteria. 

Although the system is still risky, with 9% false positive rate unchanged, it is less vulnerable to authoritarian abuse.

(text-colour:#ADA3C9)[[Move to testing phase->Crisis]]


:: PolicyLimits {"position":"1500,575","size":"100,100"}
You propose codifying safeguards to prevent political misuse, prohibiting anyone from monitoring legal gatherings, protests or political organisations. The atmosphere of the room becomes more tense. 

"This has overreach of your authority," the legal counsel reminds you. The CEO, who holds his faith tightly, said, "But with these limitations, it will affect the legal safety actions, so I don't agree with this idea."

However, you try to keep your idea that it could affect the freedom of people who wanna voice out their opinion. Other executives complain that you are too stubborn and claim that you are worried.

At last, the CEO resists but agrees to consider it under internal review.

:: PoliticalUse [Accuracy] {"position":"1500,450","size":"100,100"}
A junior developer walks around the room nervously and leans close to you slowly, "There is pressure from certain officials to use the system to monitor activists." Her voice is nearly inaudible, "Certain police and city council members are deciding to treat peaceful protests as a potential threat. People who have joined over 3 public gatherings within a month will be flagged." 

You realise it's not only about technical accuracy anymore, it's about how power structures can corrupt even well-intentioned technology, turning citizen protection into control. 

The junior developer looks at you, right now, you should...

You approach the podium while your heart races from the weight of the revelation you are about to share. The projection screen behind you displays statistical charts showing lives saved and attacks prevented and civilians protected from destruction. You present each statistical example to the audience starting with the school massacre prevention and the arms dealer ring destruction and the successful disarming of a suicide bomber. 

The audience starts to murmur as you clarify that although there have been controversies the data shows Sentinel has saved thousands of lives. Your voice remains firm while you discuss the system's weaknesses and the public protests it has generated. The audience outside holds "No More Silence" signs but you present them with concrete evidence tonight. 

The audience breaks into careful applause after the final bar graph disappears from the screen. The delicate sense of public trust begins to take root inside your chest. The growth of Sentinel will continue under constant observation and strict monitoring yet you now believe technology and humanity can progress together.

You say nothing, despite the discussion all around you. Sounds, noise make you think, but still you choose to stay silent. You understand that your silence is a kind of strategy; you don't agree, but at the same time, you don't object to the project, just stay between both. You just keep having eye contact and nod your head at times, showing a considerate expression. 

The executive treats your silence as agreeable and cooperative, they interpret it as professional discretion and company loyalty, earning you a reputation as someone who can be trusted with sensitive information

You close the folder. You thank the engineers for coming, tell them you’ll "look into it." But the next morning, the logs are gone, some even buried and encrypted. In the end, all are out of reach. You say nothing. No press conferences, no testimonies, no confrontation. And life goes on. You keep your position. Your salary. Your silence. 

At meetings, you nod along as Sentinel is praised. In public, you smile politely when reporters call it a marvel of modern security. But at night, when the world is quiet and the weight of your choice presses in, you hear their names, the ones in the file. You see their faces. You wonder what their final moments were like, and whether your hesitation to act would haunt anyone but you. 

Over time, your title means less. The paychecks blur. But the guilt? It sharpens. You become a respected figure, but one who flinches at their own reflection. You survive. But something inside you doesn’t.

You voice your support for the project, emphasising the potential of saving lives and reducing crimes in the city. All of a sudden, the room's atmosphere shifts, several executives nod and approve, while others exchange a glance. The CEO make a note on his tablet. 

Within a week, you were promoted to Senior Operations Director. When you returned to the office, your colleagues looked at you, and you discovered that a new security clearance badge lay on your desk. You have been granted access to restricted floors and secret project files. You are also being invited to join the testing group and provide advice. 

(text-colour:#ADA3C9)[[Heading out to the testing group->Crisis]]


:: SupportWithRisks [Accuracy Crisis] {"position":"1250,450","size":"100,100"}
You argue that the benefits outweigh the risks: "The potential to save lives and prevent crimes justifies the statistical margin of errors. We can't let statistical imperfection prevent us from protecting innocent lives. We can't wait until there is perfect accuracy, even though people die every day because of the security problem!" Everyone stands up and gives you applause. Executives looking at you with satisfied smiles, this is what they actually want. 

Thus, the project has been fast-tracked with emergency funding and executive priority. The timeline has changed from an 18-month gradual rollout to a 9-week emergency deployment. The normal approval process has been bypassed, and the public hearings have been cancelled. The deployment begins in high-traffic areas within days, and the public doesn't know what will happen next.

:: SystemSuccess {"position":"1200,900","size":"100,100"}
You go through the system logs one by one, taking your time but staying focused. Your heart stays steady even though your mind is racing. Each entry is more than just data - it's a story about disaster that almost happened.

A suicide bomber stopped before he reached a crowded square. An arms dealer caught in the middle of a deal at some quiet café. A school attack that got shut down before it even started.

The numbers don't tell you about the chaos that could have been. But you can see it. You can feel it. These aren't just statistics - they're actual lives, futures that still exist, families that are still together.

You let yourself breathe for a second. Then you get back to work.
By every measure, Sentinel is doing what it's supposed to do. It's protecting people. The logs make that pretty clear. But you can't shake the feeling of how much power this thing has. You know better than anyone that it cuts both ways. Every success comes with the possibility of something going terribly wrong.

Outside your office, people seem cautiously hopeful. The news is mostly positive. Commentators are giving it careful praise. But you know how easily that could change. One mistake. One innocent person dies. That's all it would take for everyone to turn against the system.

You finish looking through everything and lean back in your chair. Not relieved, just aware of what you've seen. This is incredible technology. But that means it has to be held to an even higher standard.

:: Whistleblower {"position":"1075,1025","size":"100,100"}
A thick oppressive silence engulfed the conference space. The engineers maintained nervous glances between themselves and you as they sat together at the long table. The screen light produced dramatic shadows which fell across the collection of folders that you and others had risked their safety to gather.

The lead engineer expressed his concern through a tight voice as he started his statement, "the AI system existed to defend our systems, instead the system began producing fatal errors during some point in its operation. Our investigation revealed numerous wrongful deaths and injuries together with many innocent victims...Innocent people." She swallowed hard and continuted with her statement. "The lack of accountability has been devastating because no one has received apologies or reparations. No apologies, no reparations. Just silence.”

A nearby engineer leaned in close while speaking in a barely audible tone. "The public needs your exposure of these facts. In other words, the public needs to understand the truth although it will result in total destruction. Our silence will result in more lives being taken."

A familiar feeling of dread started to build up in your chest after you took your breath. Your entire career built upon this system came to utter disapointment. As a result, you declared, "I would lose my position as well as my public image and possibly face imprisonment if I decide to reveal the truth." You clenched your fists while fighting to maintain control over your emotions. The choice to remain quiet would render me responsible for ongoing death and suffering. I can never find peace after making such a choice.
