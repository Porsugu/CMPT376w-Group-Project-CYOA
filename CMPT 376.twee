The AI engages without hesitation. Over the next few weeks, it operates with cold precision, automatically detecting and eliminating numerous targets. The system correctly identifies real threats.

<span style="color: #FFFF77;"> But it also captures countless innocent people, trapped in an unyielding web of suspicion and algorithmic certainty. </span> 

Each case chips away at your conscience. 

You remember the human faces appeared in the statistical reports: the father who never came home, the teenager wrongly flagged as a suspect, the elderly woman still waiting to be cleared.

The media produces increasingly negative reports while protests emerge and you remain caught between your admiration for the technology's operational efficiency and your disgust at its unyielding mistakes. You can't help but wonder whether you helped build a defensive system or an evil entity. Your faith in redemption diminishes with each passing life the AI takes as its operational domain expands.

You feel curious about the accuracy rate of the system's work. An engineer responds, <span style="color: #FFFF77;"> "The system has 91% accuracy..." </span> You notice the hesitation of the engineer before answering. When you look at him, he tries to avoid eye contact. 

After a short sentence, he continues, "But we do acknowledge <span style="color: #FFFF77;"> there‚Äôs'' a 9% false-positive rate.''</span> Hmm... that means there will be some innocents who will be threatened by the sonic pulses or electrical deterrents. Yet, we are... still working on it to minimize the percentage as much as we can!"

One of the engineers continues, "Which means... <span style="color: #FFFF77;">''every 11 people that has been marked, there is 1 who actually does not cause ANY threads to society.''</span> To make a better understanding, in a medium-sized downtown city, there are <span style="color: #FFFF77;"> about'' 450 innocent people per day'' who would be subjected to automated force. </span>"

Another slide flashes on the screen. If  the pilot program begins, violent incidents in the city will be <span style="color: #FFFF77;">''dropped by 38%''</span>. An engineer adds, ‚ÄúWe estimate <span style="color: #FFFF77;">''over 8,000 potential casualties will been prevented this year alone''</span> . Most interventions stop threats in under 2.3 seconds</span>, far faster than human response.‚Äù

You encrypt everything ‚Äî logs, reports, all the evidence ‚Äî and send it out through anonymous networks. No press conference. No signature. No name. Just the truth.

It catches fast. News outlets run with it. Crowds gather. Protests erupt. Politicians demand answers. CEOs are hauled before Congress. The public finally sees the system for what it is ‚Äî what they once trusted without question is now under fire.

And you? You slip back into your everyday routine. You show up to work. Sit through meetings. Sip your coffee. Act like nothing‚Äôs changed. You keep your head down while the legal team spirals, pretending you don‚Äôt hear their frantic whispers.

But every day feels like a performance. Every unexpected knock on your door makes your pulse race. You flinch when your phone rings from an unknown number. People call the whistleblower a hero, someone brave enough to speak up and vanish into the shadows.

You hear it all, but it doesn‚Äôt make you feel safe. The fear doesn‚Äôt go away. <span style="color: #FFFF77"> You did the right thing, but now you live in constant tension, unable to tell anyone the truth. </span>

You can‚Äôt relax. You can‚Äôt be known. You just keep moving forward, somewhere between pride and paranoia.

Your heart drops. That‚Äôs where Jennifer, your daughter, transfers every day after school.

Your fingers hover over the controls, trembling. Part of you wants to let the AI decide, to step back from the weight of the choice. But you can‚Äôt. Not when she‚Äôs there.

:: StayQuiet {"position":"1075,1150","size":"100,100"}
You close the folder. You thank the engineers for coming, tell them you‚Äôll "look into it." But the next morning, <span style="color: #FFFF77;"> the logs are gone </span> ‚Äî some buried, some encrypted, all out of reach. You say nothing. No press conference. No testimony. No confrontation. Life goes on. You keep your position. Your salary. Your silence.

At meetings, you nod along as Sentinel is praised. In public, you smile politely when reporters call it a marvel of modern security. But at night, when the world is quiet and the weight of your choice settles over you, you hear their names ‚Äî the ones in the file. You see their faces. You wonder what their final moments were like, and whether your hesitation will haunt anyone but you.

Over time, your title means less. The paychecks blur. But the guilt? It sharpens.

<span style="color: #FFFF77"> You become a respected figure, but one who flinches at their own reflection. You survive. But something inside you doesn‚Äôt. </span>

//You have chosen the silent tragedy over justice. It's not a dramatic failure of making a wrong choice, but just that you have chosen the long-term poison of not doing anything. <span style="color: #77c9ff">''You survived, but you pay the cost of your soul.'' </span>

The disappeared log, evidence ... is not the only cover-up of the company; it's that you place yourself on the side of the innocents' justice. Yet, the only honest part is that <span style="color: #77c9ff">''you still remember their faces. 
You keep this in mind, no matter how painful it is.'' </span>//

:: Support [Support Crisis] {"position":"525,500","size":"100,100"}
<span style="color: #FFFF77;"> You voice your support for the project, emphasising the potential of saving lives and reducing crimes in the city.</span> All of a sudden, the room's atmosphere shifts, several executives nod and approve, while others exchange a glance. The CEO make a note on his tablet. 

<span style="color: #FFFF77;">Within a week, you were promoted to Senior Operations Directorüëî. </span>

When you returned to the office, your colleagues looked at you, and you discovered that a new security clearance badge lay on your desk. You have been granted access to restricted floors and secret project files. <span style="color: #FFFF77;"> You are also being invited to join the testing group and provide advice. </span>

:: SupportWithRisks [Accuracy Crisis] {"position":"1250,450","size":"100,100"}
<span style="color: #FFFF77;"> You argue that the benefits outweigh risks </span>, "The potential to save lives and prevent crimes justifies the statistical margin of errors. <span style="color: #FFFF77;">''We can't let statistical imperfection prevent us from protecting innocent lives.''"</span>

<span style="color: #FFFF77;">"''We can't wait until there is perfect accuracy, even though people die every day because of the security problem!''" </span>

Everyone stands up and gives you applause. Executives looking at you with satisfied smiles, this is what they actually want. 

Thus, the project has been fast-tracked with emergency funding and executive priority. The timeline has changed from an 18-month gradual rollout to a 9-week emergency deployment. <span style="color: #FFFF77;">The normal approval process has been bypassed, and the public hearings have been cancelled. </span>The deployment begins in high-traffic areas within days, and the public doesn't know what will happen next.

:: SystemSuccess {"position":"1200,900","size":"100,100"}
You go through the system logs one by one, taking your time but staying focused. Your heart stays steady, even though your mind is racing. Each entry is more than just data ‚Äî it's a story of disaster that almost happened.

A suicide bomber stopped before reaching a crowded square. An arms dealer caught in the middle of a deal at a quiet cafe. A school attack shut down before it ever began.

The numbers don‚Äôt show you the chaos that might have been. But you can see it. You can feel it. <span style="color: #FFFF77;"> These aren‚Äôt just statistics ‚Äî they‚Äôre lives still lived, families still whole, futures still intact. </span>

You let yourself breathe, just for a second. Then you get back to work. By every measure, Sentinel is doing what it's supposed to do. It's protecting people. The logs make that pretty clear. But you can't shake the feeling of how much power this thing has. You know better than anyone that it cuts both ways. Every success comes with the possibility of something going terribly wrong.

Outside your office, people seem cautiously hopeful. The news is mostly positive. Commentators offer careful praise. But you know how quickly that could change. 

<span style="color: #FFFF77;"> One mistake. One innocent person dies. That's all it would take for everyone to turn against the system. </span>

You finish reading and lean back in your chair. Not relieved, just aware of what you've seen. <span style="color: #FFFF77;"> This is incredible technology. But that means it has to be held to an even higher standard. </span>

:: Whistleblower {"position":"1075,1025","size":"100,100"}
A thick, oppressive silence filled the conference room. The engineers sat tensely around the long table, exchanging anxious glances between themselves and you. The screen light produced dramatic shadows, falling across the collection of folders that you and others had risked so much to collect.

The lead engineer expressed his concern through a tight voice as she started her speech, ‚ÄúThe AI system existed to defend our systems. Instead, the system began producing fatal errors at some point in its operation. Our investigation revealed numerous wrongful deaths and injuries, together with many innocent victims... innocent people.‚Äù She swallowed hard and continued with her statement. <span style="color: #FFFF77"> ‚ÄúThe lack of accountability has been devastating because ''no one has received apologies or reparations''. Just silence.‚Äù </span>

A nearby engineer leaned in, his voice barely more than a whisper. ‚ÄúThe public needs your exposure of these facts. In other words, the public needs to understand the truth, although it will result in total destruction. <span style="color: #FFFF77"> If we stay silent, more lives will be lost. </span>‚Äù

A familiar feeling of dread started to build up in your chest after you took a breath. Your entire career, built upon this system, came to utter disappointment. As a result, you declared, <span style="color: #fd2550"> ''‚ÄúI would lose my position as well as my public image and possibly face imprisonment if I decide to reveal the truth.‚Äù'' </span>

You clenched your fists, fighting to maintain control over your emotions. The choice to remain quiet would render you responsible for ongoing death and suffering. You can never find peace after making such a choice.
